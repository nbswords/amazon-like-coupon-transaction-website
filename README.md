# amazon-like-coupon-transaction-website

A Coupon transaction website which designed as amazon front page. The final project of my Database course.

Using HTML + CSS + Bootstrap to build this amazon-like front end. 

With some basic function of shopping, like Login/Logout, add coupon to shopping cart, sell coupon, keyword search.

## Admin 
It is for administer of the Coupon transaction website.
Logging as a admin, you can cancel, sell or take off the coupon.

Notice that system will judge whether if you are a admin or just a member by your login information(Username and Password).
